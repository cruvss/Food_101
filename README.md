# Food_101
This repository contains an implementation of a Food-101 image classifier using the DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer) model . Currently, the model achieves a test accuracy of 78%. Further fine-tuning of the model is planned to improve the performance.

# Dataset: Food-101
The Food-101 dataset is a large-scale collection of food images. It contains 101 classes, each representing a different type of dish, with 1,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into:

  - **Training set:**   70,700 images (700 images per class)
  - **Test set:**       30,300 images (300 images per class)

# Current Progress

- Model Used: DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer)
- Accuracy Achieved: 78% on the test set
- Status: Fine-tuning of the final model is yet to be completed to further optimize accuracy.
